# Exan
An easy-ish to use bot to handle self-assignable roles on your discord guild

Core features:
- Multi-language support (With server defaults & user specific settings)
- Global emotes for reaction roles
- Auto restore roles if a guild member rejoins the server and still has reacts
- Commands to get/remove roles
- Easy setup
- Configurable prefix
- Opensource!

Use ;;help to get started!

If youre not sure how to use a command, you can use it and the bot will ask you for the details it requires.

To get some more info about a specific command, add `--help` at the end.

If you forget what prefix you configured, tagging the bot works as a prefix too.
